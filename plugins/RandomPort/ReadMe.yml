      Activated: determines whether or not a player will RandomPort when using a nether portal entering or exiting the nether
      Choose Randomly:
        Activated: determines if NetherPort uses PEX or randomly chooses players. If set to true, all players may randomly NetherPort, and the permission randomport.netherport has no effect. If set to false, NetherPort will only apply to players with the permission randomport.netherport, this has no effect if NetherPort is set to false
        Odds of ported out of 100: the odds out of 100 that the player will NetherPort on portal use, only matters if NetherPort and randomly chosen are set to true
